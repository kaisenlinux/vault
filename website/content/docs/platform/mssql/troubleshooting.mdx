# Troubleshooting the Vault EKM Provider

## Check Windows Event Logs

Logs from the Vault EKM provider will appear in Windows Event Viewer under
"Windows Logs" > "Application" with source "Transit Vault EKM Provider".

### Enable trace logging

If the logs in the Event Viewer don't give enough information to help debug
your issue, you can [enable trace logging](/docs/platform/mssql/configuration#enabletrace).

Restart SQL Server for the config change to take effect, and you should see more
detailed logs in the same section of Windows Event Viewer.
