# Trobuleshooting the Vault EKM Provider

## Check Windows Event Logs

Logs from the Vault EKM provider will appear in Windows Event Viewer under
"Windows Logs" > "Application" with source "Transit Vault EKM Provider".

### Enable trace logging

If the logs in the Event Viewer don't give enough information to help debug
your issue, you can enable trace logging. Find the provider's config file at
`config.json` in your install location, which defaults to
`C:\Program Files\HashiCorp\Transit Vault EKM Provider\`. Set `enableTrace` to
true, for example:

```json
{
    "vaultApiBaseUrl":  "http://vault.example.com:8200",
    "enableTrace": true
}
```

Restart SQL Server for the config change to take effect, and you should see more
detailed logs in the same section of Windows Event Viewer.
