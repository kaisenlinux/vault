# Socket Audit Device

The `socket` audit device writes to a TCP, UDP, or UNIX socket.

~> **Warning:** The loss of audit logs may occur when using the UDP socket audit type. Because UDP socket audit type is connectionless, meaning the UDP endpoint becomes unavailable, it’s possible that any number of audit logs written to it may get lost, even though the request will still succeed. Vault does not provide an indication for the loss of audit logs. Therefore, we recommend using your device in conjunction with a secondary “non-socket” audit device to ensure accuracy and to guarantee that audit logs will not be lost.

~> **Warning:** When using a TCP socket audit type, and connection loss to the socket occurs, a single audit entry may be omitted from the audit entry. The request from the TCP socket audit type will succeed despite the omission of the audit entry.

## Enabling

Enable at the default path:

```shell-session
$ vault audit enable socket
```

Supply configuration parameters via K=V pairs:

```shell-session
$ vault audit enable socket address=127.0.0.1:9090 socket_type=tcp
```

## Configuration

- `address` `(string: "")` - The socket server address to use. Example
  `127.0.0.1:9090` or `/tmp/audit.sock`.

- `socket_type` `(string: "tcp")` - The socket type to use, any type compatible
  with <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial">net.Dial</a> is acceptable. It's
  important to note if TCP is used and the destination socket becomes unavailable
  Vault may become unresponsive per [Blocked Audit Devices](docs/audit/#blocked-audit-devices).

- `log_raw` `(bool: false)` - If enabled, logs the security sensitive
  information without hashing, in the raw format.

- `hmac_accessor` `(bool: true)` - If enabled, enables the hashing of token
  accessor.

- `mode` `(string: "0600")` - A string containing an octal number representing
  the bit pattern for the file mode, similar to `chmod`.

- `format` `(string: "json")` - Allows selecting the output format. Valid values
  are `"json"` and `"jsonx"`, which formats the normal log entries as XML.

- `prefix` `(string: "")` - A customizable string prefix to write before the
  actual log line.
