# Vault UI Browser Support

Vault currently supports all 'evergreen' browsers, as they are generally on up-to-date versions. Therefore, the following browsers are supported:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

We do not support Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11). Vault follows a similar alignment with Microsoft's own stance on IE 11, found on their [support website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge).
