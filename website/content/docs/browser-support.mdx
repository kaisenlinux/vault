# Vault UI Browser Support

Vault currently supports all 'evergreen' browsers, as they are generally on up-to-date versions. Therefore, the following browsers are supported:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

!> **Warning**: We strongly caution against using Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) as you may experience degradation in feature functionality, and in some cases, Vault features may not work at all. HashiCorp no longer supports Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) and we are in alignment with Microsoft's own stance on IE 11. You can find their statement about IE 11 on their [support website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge).
We encourage that you move off of IE 11 and use one of the supported browsers listed for Vault UI.
