# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.10.x compared to 1.9. Please read it carefully.

## SSH Secrets Engine

The new default value of `algorithm_signer` for SSH CA roles has been changed
to `rsa-sha2-256` from `ssh-rsa`. Existing roles will be migrated to
explicitly specify the `algorithm_signer=ssh-rsa` for RSA keys if they used
the implicit (empty) default, but newly created roles will use the new default
value (preferring a literal `default` which presently uses `rsa-sha2-256`).

### Etcd v2 API no longer supported

Support for the Etcd v2 API is removed in Vault 1.10. The Etcd v2 API
was deprecated with the release of [Etcd v3.5](https://etcd.io/blog/2021/announcing-etcd-3.5/),
and will be decommissioned in a forthcoming Etcd release.

Users of the `etcd` storage backend with the etcdv2 API that are
upgrading to Vault 1.10 should [migrate](/docs/commands/operator/migrate)
Vault storage to an Etcd v3 cluster prior to upgrading to Vault 1.10.
All storage migrations should have
[backups](/docs/concepts/storage#backing-up-vault-s-persisted-data)
taken prior to migration.
