# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.11.x compared to 1.10. Please read it carefully.

## Elasticsearch Database Secrets Engine

The Elaticsearch Database Secrets Engine now uses the new `/_security` base API
path instead of `/_xpack/security` when managing Elasticsearch. If users are on
an Elasticsearch version prior to 6, they will need to switch back to the old
API path by setting the [bool config option](/api-docs/secret/databases/elasticdb#use_old_xpack)
`use_old_xpack=true`.

## Integrated Storage Autopilot

Vault 1.11 introduced [automated
upgrades](/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/autopilot#automated-upgrades) as 
part of the Integrated Storage Autopilot feature. If your Vault environment is
configured to use Integrated Storage, consider leveraging this new feature. See
the [Automate Upgrades with Vault
Enterprise](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/raft-upgrade-automation)
tutorial for more details.
