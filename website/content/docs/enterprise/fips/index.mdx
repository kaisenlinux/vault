# FIPS

The [Federal Information Processing Standard](https://www.nist.gov/federal-information-standards-fips)
is a cryptography-focused certification standard for U.S. Government usage.

Hashicorp's Vault Enterprise supports the modes of FIPS compliance documented below.

## FIPS 140-2 Inside

Vault Enterprise now includes release flavors with FIPS 140-2 compliant
cryptography built into the Vault binary. More information on these releases
can be found on the [FIPS 140-2 Inside](/docs/enterprise/fips/fips1402) page.

## Seal Wrap

Before our FIPS Inside effort, Vault [depended on](https://www.hashicorp.com/vault-compliance)
an external HSM for FIPS 140-2 compliance. This uses the [Seal Wrap](/docs/enterprise/fips/sealwrap)
functionality to wrap security relevant keys in an extra layer of encryption.
